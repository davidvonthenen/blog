Enterprises don't need more "vibes-based" answers… they need receipts. Vector-only RAG is great at finding passages that feel right, but when auditors ask who said what, when, and why, cosine similarity can't testify. If your world runs on policies, provenance, and repeatability, you can't ship a black box and call it a day.

Graph-based RAG puts structure back into retrieval: entities, relationships, and time are first-class, so every claim is traceable through a concrete path from question → evidence → source. It narrows the search to a grounded subgraph, boosts faithfulness, and pairs neatly with CPU-friendly inference and low-temperature decoding for consistent outputs. Add PROV-style lineage, transaction logs, and policy-aligned retention, and you've got answers your compliance team can actually sign off on. Watch the provided embedded YouTube video for more technical details.

If this sounds like the antidote to "trust me," you'll like where the whole piece goes. The blog dives into the business case: governance, reproducibility, cost control, and a pragmatic hybrid pattern that blends graph precision with vector recall. Give it a read to see how Graph RAG becomes your default Enterprise retrieval option and when to layer vectors for scale without sacrificing proof.
