RAG has been the go-to pattern for making AI smarter, but the way we build and think about agents is changing fast. At ODSC AI West, I'll be leading a workshop on how Agent2Agent and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) shift the conversation from retrieval-first to capability-first. Think of it as moving from giant, monolithic models to modular agents that can hand off tasks, extend themselves, and even act in the real worldâ€¦ all while borrowing practices we know from traditional software engineering.

This shift matters because the industry is rethinking what "intelligent" systems should look like. From specialized agents that act like software libraries to dynamic extensions that let AI perform new actions without retraining, the landscape is evolving. With real-world concerns around governance, observability, and trust, this workshop connects directly to today's biggest questions in AI.
