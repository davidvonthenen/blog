AI isn't just coming… It's already here, and it's reshaping how we think about jobs. But the big question isn't about which jobs AI will take; it’s about what new types of jobs humans will step into. We are transitioning from a knowledge-based economy to one driven by critical thinking and creative problem-solving. Soon, accessing PhD-level knowledge will be as simple as prompting an AI agent. The real skill will lie in knowing what questions to ask, how to ask them via a prompt, and how to guide AI to produce meaningful results.

BUT here’s the issue: If AI handles most knowledge tasks, how do we ensure people, especially younger generations, learn enough foundational knowledge to ask smart questions with the context that AI prompts need? There is a tricky balance between relying on AI’s intelligence and cultivating our own critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. If we don’t get this right, we'll have a generation comfortable giving commands without truly understanding how the systems they're commanding actually work.

## Balancing Knowledge Acquisition and Critical Thinking

Today, deep expertise and hands-on learning seem less profitable because AI provides rapid, high-level insights. However, true critical thinking isn't something you can instantly download from an AI model. It requires humans to spend real time mastering foundational concepts, learning from failures, and experiencing the physical and mental process of problem-solving firsthand.

![Foundational Knowledge](https://github.com/dvonthenen/blog/blob/master/images/2025/rethinking-jobs-when-ai-does-the-thinking/learning-foundational-knowledge.png?raw=true)

Adults already established in the workforce face a unique challenge here. Many have built careers on knowledge-based tasks that AI increasingly automates. For them, embracing continuous learning via 1) understanding how AI systems work, 2) how to direct them effectively, or 3) even pivoting toward entirely new roles will become crucial. The workforce will need robust retraining programs to smoothly guide mid-career professionals into roles enhanced, rather than diminished, by AI. The cynic in me knows this will largely depend on individuals with zero financial support (unless you count unemployment benefits) and formal training (such as extension courses) made available.

To effectively direct AI agents, humans must understand the basics behind the tools they use. Imagine supervising a robotics system without knowing basic mechanics, or troubleshooting code generated by AI without understanding the fundamentals of software engineering. We have already seen ["vibe coding" landing in production](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/catalinpit_vibe-coding-is-fun-until-it-isnt-people-activity-7307442202622763013-TzRH) and it isn't pretty. As I have been saying a LOT recently, if you are in the technology field, your true job is that you are a lifelong learner who MUST pivot to the next big thing happening in tech, even if it means short-term disruption to your career.

## What Future Jobs Might Look Like: Rooted in the Physical World

As AI and automation increasingly dominate knowledge-based roles, future jobs will shift towards:

- Tangible, hands-on tasks that AI struggles to replicate, or
- Where the cost-to-benefit ratio of replacing humans with AI isn't valuable enough

The future of human employment will likely be grounded in the physical world, focusing on tasks that require nuanced physical interaction, spatial reasoning, empathy, or personalized service.

![Future of Human Employment](https://github.com/dvonthenen/blog/blob/master/images/2025/rethinking-jobs-when-ai-does-the-thinking/future-of-human-employement.png?raw=true)

For tech professionals specifically, this could mean adapting from pure software roles to tech roles grounded in physical reality, such as IoT integration, robotics, hardware troubleshooting, and hands-on cybersecurity assessments. It might also mean shifting toward roles where AI serves as a complement, such as AI integration specialists or human-AI interaction designers. There has been explosive growth in AI, but honestly, I think it's only a matter of time (perhaps around 3-4 years) before we reach peak AI/ML and the natural contraction begins to occur. It has happened in EVERY wave I have caught in my career: virtualization, containerization, and it will happen to AI/ML in some form.

Humans naturally excel at adapting quickly to unpredictable situations and understanding context intuitively… areas where AI often falters. Jobs that require agility, physical dexterity, intuition, and empathy will thrive. Tech workers who embrace this shift will find new opportunities where their understanding of both technology and human interaction becomes indispensable.

### Example Job 1: Repairing Robots, IoT, and Edge Devices

Take, for example, robot repair technicians. As factories, homes, and public spaces become increasingly populated with robots and IoT devices, the job of maintaining, repairing, and optimizing these devices will be crucial. AI can diagnose many issues, but can’t perform nuanced physical repairs, deal with unexpected hardware malfunctions, or adapt flexibly to unique real-world problems.

![IoT/Edge Robots](https://github.com/dvonthenen/blog/blob/master/images/2025/rethinking-jobs-when-ai-does-the-thinking/repairing-military-drone.png?raw=true)

Software engineers and IT professionals could naturally transition into roles that blend coding skills with physical troubleshooting. AI can help quickly identify software or hardware faults, but human technicians will perform the intricate, hands-on adjustments that ensure devices run smoothly. I am from Long Beach, CA which happens to have the first and second large container ports in the United State and robotic has been been transforming the port for years, but when these automated cargo container movers need to change a tire, they are going to rely on humans to do this task.

### Example Job 2: Physical and In-Person Trades

Jobs like plumbing, electrical work, construction, and HVAC installation will remain essential… and human-driven. These jobs require fine motor skills, judgment based on real-world conditions, and improvisation in unpredictable environments. Even sophisticated robotics will struggle to navigate cramped crawl spaces, creatively reroute pipes in unexpected wall cavities, or intuitively understand the quirks of an aging home.

![Where Robots Lack Agility](https://github.com/dvonthenen/blog/blob/master/images/2025/rethinking-jobs-when-ai-does-the-thinking/robot-getting-stuck.png?raw=true)

Interestingly, professionals from technology sectors might find unexpected opportunities in these traditionally non-tech trades. The skills developed in software or IT roles, such as problem-solving, troubleshooting, and logic-based thinking, can be easily applied to these physical trades. Bringing tech skills into traditional industries can lead to lucrative niches, such as smart home installations, intelligent building automation, or specialized technical consultancy within physical trades.

### Example Job 3: Service-Related Jobs

Human-focused service jobs, such as those in healthcare, hospitality, personal training, and caregiving, will continue to see demand. These roles require empathy, sound judgment, and effective interpersonal connections. AI can complement these roles by providing better diagnostics, improved customer experience tools, or intelligent scheduling, but it cannot replace the human element of genuine care and interaction.

![Human Related Jobs](https://github.com/dvonthenen/blog/blob/master/images/2025/rethinking-jobs-when-ai-does-the-thinking/human-related-jobs.png?raw=true)

Tech professionals accustomed to remote, purely digital interactions might also find fulfilling and secure employment by pivoting toward more human-connected tech roles. Consider roles in telemedicine support, where understanding both human psychology and technology enables an engaging patient experience. Or perhaps educational technology support, blending AI tools with human interaction to create personalized learning environments. Embracing roles that bridge technology and human connection will become an increasingly rewarding career strategy.

### Example Job 4: AI Security Specialists

AI systems themselves create new security demands both in protecting and disrupting these technologies. Roles in AI security will become highly specialized, including professionals who intentionally probe AI systems to discover vulnerabilities, making AI more secure and robust against misuse. AI penetration testers will simulate attacks on machine learning systems, uncovering weaknesses that could otherwise go unnoticed until exploited maliciously.

![AI Hacker](https://github.com/dvonthenen/blog/blob/master/images/2025/rethinking-jobs-when-ai-does-the-thinking/ai-hacker.png?raw=true)

Other professionals might specialize in disrupting foreign AI systems, whether for national defense or corporate security. This requires a deep understanding of sophisticated machine-learning architectures to infiltrate, confuse, or disable these systems, thereby ensuring our own technological and geopolitical safety.

Privacy specialists will also become increasingly essential, helping individuals and organizations protect personal data and maintain anonymity in an increasingly AI-monitored environment. The growth of AI surveillance and profiling makes safeguarding privacy and anonymity more critical and complex than ever, demanding highly skilled and ethical professionals committed to navigating these nuanced challenges.

## The Full Stop Thought: The World Will Be a Different Place

The AI-driven economy will undoubtedly transform jobs, shifting value away from pure knowledge roles toward hands-on, problem-solving, and critical-thinking tasks. Rather than displacing humans entirely, AI will reshape our work, emphasizing roles that leverage uniquely human strengths, such as physical skill, creativity, adaptability, and emotional intelligence.

![Humans Helping Other Humans](https://github.com/dvonthenen/blog/blob/master/images/2025/rethinking-jobs-when-ai-does-the-thinking/humans-winning-and-helping-others.png?raw=true)

Both young professionals and adults already in the workforce must adopt a mindset of continuous learning and adaptability. Tech professionals, in particular, need to explore roles beyond traditional coding; embracing jobs that connect technology with human experiences or physical environments. Through proactive preparation and adaptation, we can ensure a balanced, human-centered future in which AI enhances, rather than replaces, our roles and responsibilities.

Ultimately, education and career strategies must prioritize foundational knowledge alongside the ability to direct and collaborate with AI. This balanced approach will ensure that humans remain at the center of innovation, building a future where people and AI coexist and grow together. The world will undoubtedly be different, but it will remain distinctly human.
