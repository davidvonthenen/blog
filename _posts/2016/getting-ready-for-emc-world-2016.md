<p>We are getting closer and closer to <a href="http://www.emcworld.com">EMC World 2016</a>. I have to admit, its approaching crazy fast. This will be my first time attending EMC World. Seems odd saying that as I have attended many conferences in my career, but never the one my company throws. This time its going to be a different conference going experience as I will be presenting two sessions in the "Code and Modern Operations" track this year. I am very excited for this opportunity to talk about things that are interesting to me and I hope that are of interest to others out there in the open source community.</p>

<p>The first session is <a href="https://www.emcworldonline.com/2016/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=2714">Introduction To Mesos &amp; Mesosphere</a>. This is basically an <a href="http://mesos.apache.org/">Apache Mesos</a> 101 type session with a focus on the company, <a href="https://mesosphere.com/">Mesosphere</a>, whom pushes the direction of Mesos. I will be co-presenting this session with <a href="https://twitter.com/strikesme">Somik Behera</a> from <a href="https://mesosphere.com/">Mesosphere</a>. For those that haven't heard about Mesos or looking to learn more about it, this is a excellent session outlining why Mesos is among the best workload schedulers in the datacenter and why its the preferred choice among companies looking to scale their applications. You can catch us both Monday morning (May 2) at 8:30am. Yes, you read that right. Going to be difficult for people to drag themselves out of bed that early in the morning... this is Las Vegas after all. Hope you all can make it!</p>

<p>My second session is <a href="https://www.emcworldonline.com/2016/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=2720">Deep Dive With Mesos &amp; Persistent Storage For Applications</a>. After getting some time to digest the information in my previous Mesos 101 session, this will dive into some of the internals of Mesos as we explore Mesos Frameworks and 2 layer scheduling. We will discuss what 2 layer scheduling means and how external storage can enhance the story around applications leveraging Frameworks. For the architects, operators, and consumers of Mesos, this session is packed with things you need to know in order to make your applications function efficiently and be highly available in order to avoid the train wreck. Ultimately the goal of talk is to enable you to put things on autopilot so you don't need to manage the application.</p>

<p>If you haven't purchases tickets for EMC World, I would highly recommend you do as soon as possible. The <a href="http://emccode.com/">EMC {code}</a> team has a huge presence this year as we have our own booth along with our own session track, Code and Modern Operations, which I eluded to earlier. The {code} team collectively has <strong>21 sessions</strong> at the conference this year talking about everything from Docker, managing larger open source communities, Mesos, and contributing to open source just to name a few. I will have a follow up blog post just before EMC World highlighting some of the other sessions you might want to check out. Catch you all later!</p>
