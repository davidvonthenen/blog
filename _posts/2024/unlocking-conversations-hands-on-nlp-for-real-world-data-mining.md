Hey there, tech enthusiasts! I'm thrilled to share that I'll be hosting an exciting workshop at the upcoming <a href="https://odsc.com/california/">Open Data Science Conference (ODSC)</a>. Titled “<a href="https://bit.ly/3Br1WNk">Building Multiple Natural Language Processing Models to Work in Concert Together</a>”, this workshop will give you a practical, hands-on approach to creating and orchestrating NLP models. It's not just another "hello world" session—this is about tackling real-world data and making it work for you.

<h2>Why NLP and Why Now?</h2>

As conversations around the world explode in number, the need to make sense of them has become more critical than ever. Think about it: 1.5 billion messages on Slack every week, 300 million daily virtual meetings on Zoom at peak, and 260 million conversations happening on Facebook every day. The sheer scale of this data is astounding. But more than that, these conversations have transformed social platforms into treasure troves of information, offering insights into emerging trends, new associations, and evolving narratives.

At the workshop, we'll delve into how to capture, analyze, and gain insights from this data using NLP. Whether you're looking to spot trends, extract key information, or mine metadata, this session will provide you with the tools and techniques to turn this overwhelming amount of unstructured conversation data into something meaningful.

<h2>What You Can Expect</h2>

This workshop will be hands-on and highly interactive, featuring three primary components:

<ol>
    <li>Building a Question Classifier: We'll start with a straightforward model that classifies sentences as questions or non-questions. You'll see that even seemingly simple tasks can get complex as we deal with language's natural ambiguity.</li>
    <li>Creating a Named Entity Recognition (NER) Model: Next, we'll move into identifying specific entities within text, such as names, places, and organizations. I'll show you how to gather, clean, and process data to build a reliable NER model that can extract meaningful information from conversations.</li>
    <li>Developing a Voice AI Assistant Demo: We'll bring it all together by integrating both models into a voice assistant app that uses a RESTful API to process input and return classified and annotated data. This is where you'll see how these models can work together in a real-world application, adding layers of context and relevance to raw data.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Why Attend?</h2>

There are plenty of reasons to be excited about this workshop, but here are a few highlights:

<ul>
    <li>Hands-on Learning: We'll be coding live! For those that are less technical and/or don't have their laptop prerequisites, I'll be using Jupyter notebooks in Google Colab, so everyone can follow along.</li>
    <li>Real-World Applications: While many workshops focus on isolated NLP models, we'll be tackling multiple models and showing how they can be combined for enhanced functionality. It's a rare opportunity to see how these technologies can be applied in real-world scenarios.</li>
    <li>Open Resources: I'll provide code, data resources, and examples that you can take with you, adapt, and use on your projects. This workshop isn't just about learning theory—it's about equipping you with tools you can use.</li>
</ul>

<h2>See You at ODSC!</h2>

I'm incredibly excited to share this workshop with you all and to dive into the nitty-gritty of NLP. Whether you're an experienced data scientist, an NLP enthusiast, or just curious about how these systems work, there will be something for you. Plus, you'll walk away with new skills and practical examples that can help you build better models and unlock new insights from conversation data.

So, if you're planning to attend ODSC, be sure to check out this session. You won't want to miss it!
