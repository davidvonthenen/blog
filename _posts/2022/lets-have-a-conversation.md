Hello! How are you doing? It’s been a while since we last chatted. Since you’re stopping by, you might notice immediately that I revived my blog (obviously). I took a break from it for a good couple of years while COVID did its thing; it made sense since we were locked indoors, unable to attend meetups, conferences, or events. Unfortunately, it seems like I did lose a couple of blog posts leading up to the shutdown, which I thought I had backup, but here we are. It’s all good… It’s just great that I can talk with you again!  

![Welcome back](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dvonthenen/blog/master/images/lets-have-a-conversation/welcome-back.jpeg)  

What’s new with me, you ask? Well, as I started to get back into the open source world again by attending meetups and conferences, I even had an opportunity to speak at a pre-conference event during [KubeCon Europe 2022](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/archive/2022/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/) about [Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery systems](https://cfp.cloud-native.rejekts.io/cloud-native-rejekts-eu-valencia-2022/speaker/R3MTLQ/). I had a chance to be a part of an incredible team that created a Kubernetes distribution from scratch and was well received.  

But... change was brewing at VMware and I found myself taking a new and exciting opportunity with a great and sharp group of people at [Symbl](https://symbl.ai/). What is Symbl? Symbl is a rapidly maturing startup focused on the Conversation Intelligence space providing a platform to help other developers integrate conversational context into their applications and services via APIs. If you’re interested in learning more, watch this presentation below by our CEO and co-founder, Surbhi Rathore.

I have enjoyed my time working on application infrastructure, Kubernetes, containers, and everything virtualization, but this is a welcome change for me. Throughout my career, I have always taken on bold, engaging, and areas in technology that represent the unknown to me. This definitely qualifies. Conversation Intelligence is exponentially growing, and we are just scratching the surface in terms of its potential applications and what new features all of us can dream up.

If you’re interested in learning more, I will invite you to visit and read through [my first blog post](https://symbl.ai/blog/make-apps-conversation-aware/) at Symbl. The blog is the first in a series that details my perspective as a new developer in the Conversation Intelligence ecosystem who is learning how to bootstrap themselves to become a power user. I aim to become a force multiplier who helps others in their journey to make their application and services conversation aware.
