It looks like that time of year again as we are just days away from [Dell EMC World 2017](http://www.dellemcworld.com/index.htm). The [{code} team](http://codedellemc.com/) will once again be in attendance and presenting some interesting sessions (16 in total), a Hands-On Lab (ran through it myself and it's great!), and various material at the show. The *buffet* (Yes, we are in Vegas after all!) of information we have lined up is pretty dang awesome! You can find more information about the stuff {code} has going on in our official [{code} at Dell EMC World](http://codedellemc.com/dellemcworld17/) page.

What I wanted to talk about today were the two sessions that I will be presenting at Dell EMC World. The first session called [Demos Demos Demos! Containers & {code}](https://emcworldonline.com/2017/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=3531) is happening on Wednesday, May 10 at 1:30 PM in room Zeno 4602. I will be co-presenting with Travis Rhoden and Vladimir Vivien. Just like the title says this session will have a few slides to set up what is going on and talk about who we are... then it's nothing but live demos. I think this will be a pretty amazing session that captures what is hot in the container and scheduler space but at the same time, will give you something practical and real-world to take home with you. Definitely, check this out!

The second session I will be presenting solo. It's called [Managing ScaleIO As Software On Mesos](https://emcworldonline.com/2017/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=3400) and is occurring on Thursday, May 11 at 11:30 AM in room Zeno 4602. I floated this idea during a session at (the then) [EMC World 2016](https://emcworldonline.com/2016/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=2720) where I thought it would be cool that we could treat storage just as another piece of software. Well now its one year later and that idea is a reality now and we are going to talk about and demonstrate the [ScaleIO Framework](https://github.com/codedellemc/scaleio-framework) in this session. Many other container schedulers have implementations of this pattern and this idea will change the way how we consume software in the future.

If you are heading down to Dell EMC World this year, stop by the sessions the {code} team will be presenting at and if you have any questions, feel free to linger around the presentations to chat. I think this is going to be an awesome conference and show, check out some of the social networking opportunities available to connect with some new people, and as always enjoy the show and have fun (but not too much... it's Vegas after all)!
