My recap of LinuxCon ContainerCon Japan just went live on the [EMC {code} Blog](https://blog.emccode.com/2016/07/20/linuxcon-japan-wrap-up/) and it talks about some of the things that happened at the conference as well as talks about some key takeaways. I definitely encourage you to go and take at the article. This happens to be my first blog post on the official EMC {code} Blog. Yay!

### On to the Fun Stuff

It has been some time since I have been to Japan, but going back was a lot of fun. Below is a not so serious look at Japan outside of the seriousness of the conference.

Walking through one of Japan's many multi-story electronic stores, I found a $1300 Rice Cooker. Yes, that amount isn't a typo. I hope that thing washes my car too for that price.

We found this Okinawan restaurant and found this guy parked outside.

And in that bar, I got an opportunity to try [Habushu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habushu) which is a Japanese Liquor made with a snake in the bottle (picture below). Yes, there is a snake inside. No joke. Habushu is named after the habu snake, Trimeresurus flavoviridis, which belongs to the pit viper family and is closely related to the rattlesnake and copperhead. (according to wikipedia)

On our last night, we visited the world famous [Golden Gai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinjuku_Golden_Gai) in Shinjuku. It is roughly six alleys connected together that has over 200 tiny shanty-style bars. Each bar is large enough to hold 5-8 people max with most of the ones we saw being about the size of a 5ft x 7ft room.

Last but not least, when you are tried of eating conference bento boxes everyday and you need a change... you get KFC. That also isn't a joke either. By the way, KFC is waaaaay better in Japan than in the states. Just saying!
